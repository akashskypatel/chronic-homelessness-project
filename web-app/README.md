Front end web application that allows users to enter and maintain local agency information.

## Getting started

1. Download and install [Node.jS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

2. Fork this repo or download sorce files to your local machine

3. If you use VS Code you can just open "web-app.code-workspace" thats in "web-app" folder in the IDE. Otherwise, open "web-app" folder in your choice of IDE. 

4. Open a terminal/console in your IDE

5. Run the following commands 

Install angular cli and yarn globally
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install -g yarn
```
Install all project dependencies
```
yarn install
```
6. You should now be able to run the development server with the following command. This will open the web application in your default browser. Alternatively you can navigate to the application by opening `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser after running below command.
```
ng serve -o
```
7. To terminate the dev server in VS Code press Ctrl+C (both mac and pc) in the terminal/concole. If you are using another IDE check your IDE's console interrupt shortcut.

## Updating your local repo

1. Fork the repo again or sync your repo with the source branch

2. Open web-app folder in your IDE

3. Open a console/terminal window in "web-app" folder in your IDE and make sure angular and yarn are installed globally

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install -g yarn
```

4. Re-install/Update project dependencies
```
yarn install
```

5. Run the project normally (See steps 6-7 in Getting started instructions)


# Other Angular commands for reference

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
